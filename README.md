# MedicalReport
This repository contains Power BI file for the medical report and the Python code that has been used for data cleaning and prediction modelling.

The Report.pbix file contains 4 reports.
  - Activity : Shows the yearly and monthly activity in the hospital, and numbers based on the Age and Specialty.
  - Length of Stay : Shows the details on the legth of stay in patients of different age groups, specialty and under different doctors
  - Comparison : Shows the comparison of number of patients under each specialty and doctor versus the average length of stay.
  - Predicted Change : This contains a chart on the number of patients with their age increased by 20%, and their predicted specialty with that increased age, and the number of       patients in each specialty with this 20% increased age. To compare I have also provided the visualisation of the current number of patients in the diffrent specialties here.
 
The Python Code consists of the code for data cleaning, and manipulation of data to gain insights on the sample medical data. Also, it contains code for prediction of number of beds required if the age of all patients are increased by 20%.
